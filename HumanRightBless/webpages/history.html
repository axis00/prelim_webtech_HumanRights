        <p>
            During 1950's, the whole area of Aurora Hill which covers the area of Leonila Hill was called "The Working Man's Village". In 1956, thee owner of the area of Leonila Hill sold the 12.2 hectares land to a developer, the area was then named "Sunrise Subdivision" by that time. After sometime, because of a transaction made by the developer to the GSIS, the ownership of the land transferred to the government.

            In the term of President Carlos P. Garcia, the subdivision was renamed to "Leonila Hill" but still was not considered as a barangay. The name of the land was taken after the name of the first lady, Leonila Garcia</p>
        <p>
            In 1958's'and the further years, the city was divided into barangays. The upper part of leonila hill became west bayan park barangay and the lower portion of the subdivion became north bayan park barangay according to their locations.</p>
        <p>
            Today, Leonila Hill is a part of baguio city. Like most other barangays , it is a cozy place to live in that offers an experience of simplicity, sincerity and consistency of the barangay. It displays the ambience that you searching for, friendly neighbors and commitees at your service, and clean and alluring climate and environment.
